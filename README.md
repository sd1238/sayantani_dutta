## About Me

I am a highly skilled professional with a solid background in higher education and a genuine passion for computer science. My expertise includes teaching, teacher training, tutoring, and curriculum development. I am currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.msstate.edu/) from Mississippi State University. 

My research focuses on advancing Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence literacy among middle school students. I am particularly interested in educational enhancements in Computer Science Education and Artificial Intelligence for underprivileged K-12 students. Additionally, I am exploring game-based learning and educational gamification using board games and playing cards. 

My ultimate goal is to make substantial contributions to this cutting-edge field. I look forward to discussing how my skills and expertise can contribute to the success of your team.
